This is a small compiler that is in the works. It compiles a made up low-level programming language into an executable output for x64 Linux.

## Try it

### Build it

There are no releases yet so to try this program you have to build it yourself.
- Linux x64 required
- Install NASM and GCC
- Clone this repository
- Run `cargo build`
- You'll find the executable in `target/debug/kathleen`.

### Run it

(in these examples I will assume you added `<path/to/project>/target/debug` to your path.)

To display the help menu run
```sh
kathleen
```
or
```sh
kathleen help
```
To compile a program run
```sh
kathleen <src> <output-name> [options]
```
For example:
```sh
kathleen hello.kl hello
```
This will create an executable you can run with `./hello` out of your program in `hello.kl`.
